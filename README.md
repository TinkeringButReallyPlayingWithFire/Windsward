"Windsward" is my final project submission for my Introduction to Programming II module, as part of my BSc Computer Science degree.

Windsward serves as a more _rustic_ approach to a drawing application and incorporates many tools to aid in a users creative needs. As well as a 'toolbox' of a myriad of tools, the background can also change color as well as a feature to import an image and also use said image as a base to trace if needed.

Windswards core theme in terms of color and layout is based on autumn, and I conceptually thought of windmills in fall which stuck with me thoughtout the entire process:- from pre planning to the first initialisation.
